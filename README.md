## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hook Form
- Axios
- React Router DOM

### Backend

- NestJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize ORM
- JWT Authentication
- Swagger API Documentation
- bcryptjs for password hashing

### Database

- PostgreSQL

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- yarn
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd book-management-system
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm run install:all
```

### 3. Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database named `book_management`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE book_management;
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Update the database configuration in `backend/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-password
DATABASE_NAME=book_management
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
PORT=3001
```

### 5. Run the application

```bash
yarn run start
```

This will start both frontend (http://localhost:3000) and backend (http://localhost:3001) servers.

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, you can access the Swagger API documentation at:
http://localhost:3001/api/docs

## Usage

### Authentication

1. **Register**: Create a new account with username, email, and password
2. **Login**: Sign in with username/email and password

### Book Management

1. **View Books**: See all books in the system
2. **My Books**: View only your added books
3. **Add Book**: Create a new book entry
4. **Edit Book**: Modify your book details
5. **Delete Book**: Remove your books
6. **Search**: Find books by title, author, or genre

### Features

- **User Roles**: Regular users and admins
- **Book Status**: Available, Borrowed, Reserved
- **Search**: Full-text search across title, author, and genre
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get current user profile

### Books

- `GET /books` - Get all books
- `GET /books?my=true` - Get current user's books
- `POST /books` - Create new book
- `GET /books/:id` - Get book by ID
- `PATCH /books/:id` - Update book
- `DELETE /books/:id` - Delete book
- `GET /books/search?q=query` - Search books

### Users

- `GET /users` - Get all users (authenticated)
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `PATCH /users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user

This will start:

- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Backend API on port 3001
- Frontend app on port 3000

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
yarn run start:dev
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
yarn run start
